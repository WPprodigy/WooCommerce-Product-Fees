WooCommerce Product Fees allows you to add additional fees at checkout based on products that are in the cart.

== Description ==

A WooCommerce plugin that adds a product settings tab for creating additional fees that show up at checkout if that product is in the cart.

In the WooCommerce products edit screen, there will be a new product data tab called 'Product Fees' where you can:

* Give the fee a custom name that is displayed to the customer at checkout describing the fee.
* Enter the cost of the fee as either a flat rate number or as a percentage.
* Choose whether or not the fee should be multiplied based on the quantity of the product in the cart.

= Features =

I have kept this plugin simple on purpose. It is very lightweight and should not conflict with any other plugins or themes. I plan to continually add new features such as category fees and variation specific fees. But for now the two main features include:

* Percentage based fees that go off of the product's price.
* The ability to toggle on and off the quantity multiplier per product.

== Installation ==

= Minimum Requirements =

* WordPress 3.8 or greater
* WooCommerce 2.3 or greater

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of WooCommerce Product Fees, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “WooCommerce Product Fees” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found the plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading this plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
